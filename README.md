## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify knowledge of flex and grid. I tried both when creating the desktop design, but ended up using flex.

### Continued development

I would like to focus on responsive design and the transition between the two. The current solution doesnt have the nices transition, so it something I will defenitely work on.

### Useful resources

- [Taking on a FrontEndMentor.io challenge!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K27WULzr2P8&t=6581s) - This helped me with the background design. Obviously his approach is much more thorough, I tried to solve the challenge with just basic html & css, but it was still very usefull to watch how someone with more experince solved the challenge focusing on every detail.
